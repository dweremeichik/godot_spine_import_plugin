Spine Importer is a plugin for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). 
It is designed to make 2D rigging significantly faster and more accurate by placing your rigging textures for you.

## How to install

Official installation instructions may be found [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html#installing-a-plugin).
You may either install through the Godot Asset Library, or you can download a zip file directly from GitHub.

## How to use

To use this plugin simply enable it, you can find the official instructions [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html#enabling-a-plugin).
Add your images/textures to your project along with your Spine.json file. Your Spine.json file should now behave like a Scene inside of the godot editor. If everything worked well, you should see your sprites laid out appropriately.

> Note: You may need to re-import your Spine.json file from the import dock if your Spine.json file was imported before your images/textures were.
